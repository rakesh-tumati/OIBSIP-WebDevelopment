    <h1>Tribute to Mahatma Gandhi</h1>
    <img src="gandhi.jpg" alt="Mahatma Gandhi">
    <p>
      Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, popularly known as <span class="highlight">Mahatma Gandhi</span>, was an Indian
      lawyer, politician, and social activist who played a key role in India's struggle for independence from
      British rule. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gandhi is internationally recognized for his philosophy of <span class="highlight">nonviolence</span> and
      <span class="highlight">civil disobedience</span>. He believed in peaceful protests and passive resistance to
      bring about political and social change. His principles of truth, nonviolence, and peaceful coexistence
      continue to inspire people around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gandhi led various movements and campaigns, including the <span class="highlight">Salt March</span> and the
      <span class="highlight">Quit India Movement</span>. His relentless efforts and dedication to the cause of
      independence inspired millions of Indians to join the struggle against British colonial rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from his political activism, Gandhi also focused on promoting <span class="highlight">education</span>,
      <span class="highlight">equality</span>, and <span class="highlight">self-sufficiency</span> in rural
      communities. He championed the use of <span class="highlight">khadi</span> (homespun cloth) as a symbol of
      self-reliance and as a way to boycott foreign goods.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gandhi's teachings and philosophy extend beyond the realms of politics. He emphasized the importance of
      <span class="highlight">simplicity</span>, <span class="highlight">truth</span>, <span class="highlight">humility</span>,
      and <span class="highlight">compassion</span>. His famous quote, "Be the change you wish to see in the world,"
      continues to inspire individuals to make a positive impact in their own lives and society as a whole.
    </p>
    <p class="quote">"An eye for an eye only ends up making the whole world blind."</p>
